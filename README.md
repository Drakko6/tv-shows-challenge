# Project to show TV series

This project was made with React, and the architecture was based on the component's need.

The app is a single page application, with a modal component to show more information about the TV series

## Technologies and libraries used

React hooks: useState and useEffect to handle the changes in the app's use case
Sass: This library allow use to use variables, nest classes and is easy to use to add style
Material UI: A component library to have very flexible components and some icons required to do the app
Sweetalert2: In order to show warnings and information alerts
React-html-parser: Library to convert text in string format to JSX code (because the summary of shows came with some html tags)

### Some improvements

If I had more time, maybe I could do some refactoring to the code, in order to make it more reusable, also I could use redux to reduce the states between components
